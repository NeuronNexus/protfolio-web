    bio: "I'm Milind, a second-year Data Science student at IIT Madras who refuses to sit still. I chase problems that look impossible at first glance and break them down until the solution feels obvious. Whether it's building products, hacking together prototypes at 3 AM, or experimenting with new tools just for fun, I'm always looking for the next challenge to level up.",
